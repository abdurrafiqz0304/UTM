                                        <br><p>Today, I'm working on a digital logic circuit to enhance my understanding through practical 
                                          experiments rather than just theory. This lab requires me to partner with my roommate. Initially,
                                          it was challenging because we had to handle many wires, and I got puzzled. We decided to start over from scratch. <br><br>
                                          Finally, it worked! We got Dr. Haliza's signature to approve our circuit. After that, we answered some questions to match
                                          our results with the theory. Happily, we succeeded and submitted the paper with a smile.
