                                        <br><p>Today morning, I learn how to Assembel and reassemble a PC. This is a new experienced for me
                                            eventho I'm really scared if the PC got damage but it is fun to play with it. Here are some step to assembel a PC:
                                            <ul id="steps">
                                                <br><li>Open the case</li>
                                                <li>Take off all the connected wires.</li>
                                                <li>Take off the power supply</li>
                                                <li>Take off the RAM</li>
                                                <li>Take off the Hard Disk</li>
                                                <li>Take off the CPU fan</li>
                                            </ul><br>
                                            For reassemble, just reverse the steps. Hopefully it runs well.
                                            After the Lab, we going to take a quiz about what we learnt before. It's easy if you remember the steps.
