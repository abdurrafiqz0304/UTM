            Today morning, I learn how to Assembel and reassemble a PC. This is a new experienced for me
eventho I'm really scared if the PC got damage but it is fun to play with it. Here are some step to assembel a PC:

  1. Open the case
  2. Take off all the connected wires.
  3. Take off the power supply
  4. Take off the RAM
  5. Take off the Hard Disk
  6. Take off the CPU fan

For reassemble, just reverse the steps. Hopefully it runs well.
After the Lab, we going to take a quiz about what we learnt before. It's easy if you remember the steps.
